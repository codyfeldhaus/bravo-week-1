/*
You're creating a simple to do list. 

Given an array of tasks to complete, print each task out 
in a numbered list indicating the order of the tasks.

Example input: ["Do dishes", "Sweep floor", "Feed dog"]

Example output:
1. Do dishes
2. Sweep floor
3. Feed dog

Note: This is totally separate/different from the to do list project.
